# Hardhat Smart Contract Lottery

## Introduction
This repository contains a Smart Contract Lottery system developed as part of my blockchain learning journey. The project leverages Hardhat and integrates Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) and Chainlink Keepers, creating an automated and decentralized lottery experience.

## Project Overview
The Smart Contract Lottery is a fully autonomous system, requiring no manual intervention for its operation. It demonstrates advanced concepts such as the use of Chainlink VRF for randomness in lottery draws and Chainlink Keepers for scheduled tasks, making the lottery process transparent and trustless.

### Key Features
- **Chainlink VRF**: Ensures fair and verifiable randomness in lottery draws.
- **Chainlink Keepers**: Automates the lottery draw process without the need for manual intervention.
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event logging for transparent and traceable transactions.
- **Mock Contracts**: Utilization of mock contracts in testing environments.

### Technology Stack
- **Smart Contract Development**: Solidity, Hardhat
- **Testing and Automation**: Mocha, Chai, Chainlink VRF, Chainlink Keepers
- **Version Control**: Git
